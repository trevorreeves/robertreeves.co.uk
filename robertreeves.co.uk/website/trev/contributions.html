			<p>Can we first thank everybody who’s helped so far with the preparations.  You being there on the day is the best gift you can give us, and the only one needed (we really mean it!).</p>
			
			<p>However, if you really wish to contribute further to our day, here are a number of suggestions:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><p>If you enjoy baking, it would be great if you could bring a home made cake of your choosing to go with our afternoon tea and cake.  Please let us know in advance if and what you’re baking so we know how much is being brought, and what to look forward to.</p></li>
				<li><p>Bring a photo of yourselves from a previous wedding that you really enjoyed (maybe from your own) - there’ll be a place to display everyone’s photos on the day (and you will get them back).</p></li>
				<li><p>If that isn’t enough and you still want to contribute more and you feel so inclined, we will be collecting donations for the following two Bristol based charities that we both believe make a difference.  If you wish to do this then make a note of it in your wedding card :</p>
					<ul class="page-sublist">
						<li>
								<h6><a href="http://www.refugee-action.org.uk/bristol/advice.aspx" target="_refugee">Refugee Action Bristol</a></h6>
								<p>Refugee Action in Bristol work with lots of other organisations to improve access to services for asylum seekers and refugees, to help understand refugees’ experiences, plan how to be more accessible and to help communities and organisations live and work more easily and happily together with refugees. They also give much needed advice and support to refugees who are among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our city.</p>
							
						</li>
						<li>
								<h6><a href="http://www.thebristolbikeproject.org/" target="_bike">Bristol Bike Project</a></h6>
								<p>They provide renovated bicycles to members of underprivileged and marginalised groups that would not otherwise have the opportunity to own one. The Project combines a surplus of unwanted bikes (most of which are otherwise destined for landfill), volunteers of all abilities and marginalized people within our community in need of affordable and sustainable transportation.</p>
								<p>If you have any unwanted but salvagable bycicles you wish to donate/get rid of, then bring them along to the wedding and we can deliver them to Bristol Bike Project.</p>
							
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><p>Alright, as a last resort, if none of these things suit you, and you still feel compelled to give something, then either a very small cash contribution towards our honey moon would be gratefully received or if you're the present kind, you can contact Diana Brown (<a href="mailto:dianajedi@aol.com">dianajedi@aol.com</a>, 07910439995) who has a small list of present ideas.  But really, just turning up will be the best thing!</p></li>
